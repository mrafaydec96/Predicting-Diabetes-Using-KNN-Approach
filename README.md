# Predicting-Diabetes-Using-KNN-Approach
This project makes projections and analyzes diabetic or non-diabetic patients using the below health indicators. Users can input their health vitals to get the categorization of being diabetic or nondiabetic.


# Variables used for prediction

1- Urea: Indicates kidney function by measuring the waste product produced during protein breakdown.


2- Cr: Creatinine serves as an indicator of kidney function, reflecting the breakdown of muscle-derived creatine.


3- HbA1c: HbA1c provides a 2-3 month average of blood glucose levels, crucial for assessing long-term diabetes control.


4- Chol: Cholesterol, a fatty substance, is essential for cell building, and monitoring levels is vital for cardiovascular health.


5- TG: Triglycerides, a blood fat, are associated with cardiovascular risk when elevated.


6- HDL: HDL, or "good" cholesterol, aids in removing harmful cholesterol from the bloodstream.


7- LDL: LDL, or "bad" cholesterol, can contribute to arterial plaque buildup, increasing heart disease risk.


8- VLDL: VLDL carries triglycerides and elevated levels may indicate a heightened risk of cardiovascular diseases.


9- BMI: A ratio of weight to height, categorizes individuals into underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese, offering insights into health and disease risk.


# Accuracy of model
The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm used in this project had a remarkable accuracy of 91%. However, an accuracy of 99% or more is desirable if this algorithm needs to be implemented as a practical medical diagnostic test.
